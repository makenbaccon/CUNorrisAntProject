Hi, so I was wondering about making an ant farm with gell so it could be viewed in 3d and managed to find some interesting things on the gell:
including the patent: http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5803014/fulltext.html
but far better, evidently a japanese desert makes great gell as long as you add an antifungal which is tempting to try: http://antfarm.yuku.com/topic/8136 (its twards the end right before the angry moderatior)
