1. How many foragers can one patroller inform?


2. I was wondering if there was more data on the patroler return rate verses forager gathering rate.
What is the rate of foraging for 10 real patrolers returning verses 10 beads returning.

3. How do ants find their way back to the nest?

4. Memory?

5. Do ants ever bring anything other than food back to the nest (accident or intentional).

6. How long do foragers (successfull or unsuccessful) spend in the nest after coming back?

7. What happens when the patrollers return at a rate of 1 every 10 seconds but they are not allowed to leave their trails behind to guide the foragers to the proper sites?
