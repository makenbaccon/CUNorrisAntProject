Development of the Computer Model

Choice of language: Netlogo
	Watch a system over time
	"agents" logo fondly known as turtles
	implementation of breeds
	develop roles for small (individual ant)
	results of larger (ant colony)

Programming the model
	Use reasearch for development of breeds and foundation of behavior
	Fill in the gaps

Program design: state machine
	only execute relevant code
	based of breed (net partroller, forager etc..)
	run really fast
	
	visual outside
	hidden inside

Example behaviors in model:
	forager
		(1) if enough food present (reported by trail patrollers) leave nest
		(2) go in direction of food (information from trail patroller)
		(3) once far enough outside nest small random walk
		(4) constantly be looking at the color of ground
		(5) if matches color of food - take food
		(6) when have food go back to nest
		(7) when at nest and have food interact with ants in anty-chamber
	


Details of interaction in the simulation
	Task is based off of interactions
	interactions primarily occur in anty-chamber
	scent is passed from one ant to another
		once reach certain level start that given task
	results in waves of ants
		nest patrollers report successful --> foraging starts

Information gathered from model
	count of all breeds
	impact of relaying information
	food supply
