* Determine the rate at which ants are born
	- Foody Supply?
	- Seasonal?
	- 2 Months/weeks for egg to hatch

Nest Maitence/Forager
	- Most Documented
	- At the start of the day reset count
	- Barries cause the Nest maitence to decrease
	- Clarify what midden and nest maitence is 
	- Simplify that nest maintence and midden is the same
	- Make ants appear from inactive if need help
	- partollers stay out in the day and relay information from midden to inactive
	- Nest maintence (inside and outside?)
	- one kind of partoller or two - multiple signals
	- nest patroll --> trail patroll --> crud Patroll
	- Madness of interactions
		- See graph!
