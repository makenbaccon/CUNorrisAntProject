Cell["\<\
The flexibility of colony organization in the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex \
barbatus, was
investigated in the field in older (about 5 years) and younger (about 2 \
years) colonies. Perturbations
affecting nest maintenance work, foraging and patrolling were made singly and \
in various combinations.
In both younger and older colonies, events that directly affected only one \
activity caused changes in the
numbers of ants engaged in other activities. An increase in patrolling early \
in the activity period caused
foraging to decrease later on. Combined perturbations show that in both \
younger and older colonies, all
three activities were linked by complex, synergistic interactions: the \
response to a perturbation affecting
one activity itself varied, depending on the states of the other activities. \
The results suggest a more strongly
homeostatic response to perturbations in older colonies than in younger ones: \
older colonies appeared to
respond more consistently to single perturbations, and to decrease foraging \
less in combined
perturbations, than did younger ones. Individual workers live only about a \
year. Thus similarities and
differences in the flexibilities of colonies 3 or more years apart are \
organizational rather than a result of the
accumulated experience of particular individuals. Ontogenetic changes in a \
colony\[CloseCurlyQuote]s response to
environmental stress may be ecologically important.\

1 July-10 August 1985

37 older colonies and 35 younger ones

The colonies to be used in the experiments was based on the measurements of: \
nest size, cleared area (measured as the distance between the closest two \
ushes stradling the nest enterance), area covered with pebbles, width of \
cleared foraging trails. The colonies age was then estimated by comparing \
measures of the nest zise with thos colonies with large well established \
nests in 1981 (were 5 years old). 

The mean cleared distance for older colonies was 137.4 cm, for young colonies \
it was 66.3 cm. 

The mean foraging trail for older colonies was 9.4 cm and for younger \
colonies it was 6.9 cm\

Three types of pertubations were made: 
\tNest maintenence activity was increased by placing a pile of toothpicks \
near the nest entrance, which nest maintenance workers carried to the eadges \
of the nest mound and then ignored. 
\tThe number of foracers were decreased by placing plastic bariers on the \
foraging trails that the ants could only bypass with some duificulty \
(discription of barriers in Gordon 1986.
\tTo examine Patroling a thrid pertubation consisting of two simultanious \
minipulations, referred to jointly as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]commotion\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was introduced. First, alien ants (a different \
species I dont want to speel out, will call it NC) were collected with an \
aspirator and released on the PB nest mound near the nest entrance at the \
beginning of the activity piriod when patrollers were first emerging. The NC \
circled around, were chased by PB workers and were always gone within the \
hour. NC is active at night and while ants do occasionally venture onto \
harvester ant mounds early in the morning they are usually back to their own \
nests when the patrollers begin. At the same time patrolling was elicited \
using a small cylinder (5cm\[Cross]4-5cm) attached y a thin wire to a heavier \
wire stake 7-5 cm high. The wire snake was put deep into the nest mound near \
the entrance taking care not to go deep enough to cave in any nest chambers. \
One edge of the cylinder rested on the nest entrance and moved around \
slightly in the wind. The patrollers inspected it, crawled on it and \
eventually ignored it \

LATER: Mortality of young colonnies is very high, presubably as a result of \
competition for food between sympatrick harvester ant species and granivorous \
rodents. PB colonies seem to become established and their growth rates begin \
to level off, at about 5 years (gordons personal observation).

LATER: I did perturbation experiments
using colonies about 2 years old, probably
containing only one-fifth as many ants as the older
colonies (MacKay 1981; Markl & Holldobler,
personal communication). Although it seems to be
generally true of most ant species that the distribution
of workers of different age and/or size classes
changes as a colony matures
